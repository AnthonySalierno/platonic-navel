# Project Name LunchTrain

There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  LunchTrain

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  Find people to eat and drink with and places to go by viewing recommendations from people in your network.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  LunchTrain allows users to view curated reviews for restaurants and bars and to coordinate going to those places in groups.  If you missed it when your colleagues headed to the bar, just open up LunchTrain and look for trains (groups of people) and find their station (bar or restaurant) on LunchTrain and hop on (meet up with them).  Or if you're interested in trying something new, check out what places your friends have reviewed and put on your conductor cap and schedule a train to go check a place out.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Our product solves the problem of people missing out on group activities because they were unaware they were going on or just weren't ready when the group was ready.  Additionally, our product allows users to view curated restaurant and bar reviews from real people who they actually know, establishing a higher level of trust in the reviews than on traditional review sites such as FourSquare or Yelp.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Our product elegantly solves the problem through a simple user interface that directs users to view existing trains or look at nearby locations to create trains for places they would like to try.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  Technology is great, but so is personal connection - we're using technology to enhance connection not replace it.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Just log on and view trains or places that people in your network have reviewed.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  I'm never out of the loop about places my friends have recommended or where to go to meet up with my friends for dinner or drinks.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
